            <p>SasksVoice is a community-powered content platform that gives everyone a voice. Submit your images and
                captions, and once reviewed, they get published directly to our Instagram page.</p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>We believe everyone has something worth sharing. SasksVoice bridges the gap between content creators and
                audiences by providing a simple, accessible platform for community expression.</p>

            <h2>How Submissions Work</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Free Posts:</strong> Standard submissions that go through our review queue.</li>
                <li><strong>Promotional Posts:</strong> $1–$2 for priority review and guaranteed publishing.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Content Guidelines</h2>
            <p>All submissions go through our automated moderation system to ensure community safety. Posts containing
                hate speech, explicit content, spam, or harmful material will be automatically flagged and rejected.</p>
